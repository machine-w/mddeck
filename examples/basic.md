# Welcome to mddeck

A **markdown-first** slide deck engine produces 3D prez senta powered by [impress.js](https://impress.js).

---

<!-- _position: { x: 1500, y: 0 } -->

# 3D Position

This slide is offset to the right at 3D coordinate (1500, 0, 0).

The 3D transition between slides is rendered by impress.js in the browser.

---

<!--
_position: { x: 0, y: -1500 }
_rotate: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 90 }
-->

# Rotated 90°

This slide is above and rotated 90° around the Z axis.

---

<!--
_position: { x: -1500, y: 0, z: -800 }
_rotate: { x: -15, y: 10, z: 0 }
_scale: 1.5
-->

# Deep 3D

This slide uses **scale: 1.5**, **x: -1500**, **y: 0**, **z: -800**, and
mild rotation around the X and Y axes — enough to show off the 3D
effect while keeping the slide comfortably inside the viewport.

# Code Example

```typescript
import { MdDeck } from '@machine-w/mddeck-core'

const md = new MdDeck({ theme: 'gaia' })
const { html, css } = md.render(markdownSource)
```

The rendered HTML is ready to be served as a single-file deck.

# Lists work too

- First item appears immediately
- Second item after a click
- Third item after another click

Use `*` for bullet items that animate in.
